# PRISM Dataset: Code for Data Processing and Visualization

This repository contains supporting code for the **PRISM dataset**, a curated collection of building geometries paired with simulation-ready environmental performance outputs (e.g., CFD, solar). The code is intended to help users preprocess simulation outputs and explore dataset contents using a provided example geometry.

## Contents

This repository includes the following components:

### `vtk_to_npy.py`
Converts simulation output files from `.vtk` format to NumPy arrays (`.npy`) for efficient loading and downstream processing.  
 *Based on the [Neural-Solver-Library](https://github.com/thuml/Neural-Solver-Library). See Attribution section below.*

###  `calc_rot_npy.py`
Post-processes `.npy` performance arrays by applying geometric transformations (e.g., rotations). Useful for data augmentation and analyzing orientation effects.

### `visualizePRISM.ipynb`
A Jupyter notebook to visualize all available modalities (geometry and performance) for a **single sample instance**. Designed to support quick exploration and understanding of dataset structure.

## Dataset Access

The **PRISM dataset** is publicly hosted on **Harvard Dataverse**:

> ðŸ”— [[[https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XXXXX](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/previewurl.xhtml?token=57c1017c-2ff4-4b78-8f3e-4608b3ccb5ea)](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XXXXX](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/previewurl.xhtml?token=57c1017c-2ff4-4b78-8f3e-4608b3ccb5ea)) 

A complete sample geometry folder is included in the dataset to support rapid testing and inspection. This repository assumes the sample folder is available locally and paths in the notebook or scripts are updated accordingly.
